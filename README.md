# lists

1.Write a Python function to calculate the sum of all elements in a given list.

Largest and Smallest Elements:
Create a Python function that finds the largest and smallest elements in a list.

Remove Duplicates:
Write a Python function to remove duplicates from a list and return a new list with unique elements.

List Reversal:
Implement a Python function to reverse a given list without using the built-in reverse() method.

List Slicing:
Create a Python function that takes a list and two indices as input and returns a new list containing elements between those indices.

List Comprehension:
Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the even elements from a given list.

Count Occurrences:
Write a Python function that counts the occurrences of a specific element in a list.

List Concatenation:
Create a Python function that concatenates two lists and returns the resulting list.

List Sorting:
Write a Python function that sorts a list of integers in ascending order using a custom sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort).

Find Common Elements:
Implement a Python function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the common elements between them.

List Flattening:
Write a Python function to flatten a nested list and return a single-dimensional list.

List Operations:
Create a Python function that performs basic list operations like append, insert, remove, pop, and extend.

Split List into Chunks:
Implement a Python function that divides a list into smaller chunks of a specified size and returns a list of lists.

List Intersection:
Write a Python function that takes multiple lists as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are common in all the input lists.

List Element Replacement:
Create a Python function that replaces all occurrences of a specific element with another element in a given list.
